# Snippets

Small snippets of code that I used for answers in the [**Photoshop ecosystem**](https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem/ct-p/ct-photoshop) of [**Adobe Support Community**](https://community.adobe.com/ "Adobe Support Community").

Most snippets have a link to the topic in which the issue was discussed (this is necessary to understand the context of their work). Also, whenever possible, I try to add videos with examples of work.
