# Snippets

Snippets of code that I used for answers in the [**Photoshop ecosystem**](https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem/ct-p/ct-photoshop) of [**Adobe Product Community**](https://community.adobe.com/ "Adobe Support Community") and some interesting answers of other users.

Most snippets in have a link to the topic in which the issue was discussed (this is necessary to understand the context of their work) and a link to a video with an example of work (if possible).
